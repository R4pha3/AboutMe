    <string name="bio"> Hi, my name is Aleks.
    In\nI love fish.
    In\nThe kind that is alive and swins around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
    InFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
    In\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
    \nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
    \nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
    In\nonce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
    In\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium
    InYou should ask someone else about fishing, though. \n\n
